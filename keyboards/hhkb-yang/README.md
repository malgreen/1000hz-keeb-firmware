# Yang BLE module for HHKB
Firmware for the **BLE module for HHKB**, made by Yang, supporting 1000hz
#
Credits to [u/Kanru](https://www.reddit.com/user/kanru/) for creating the [QMK port](https://github.com/kanru/qmk_firmware/tree/hhkb_yang/keyboards/hhkb/yang)

*Notice*: The default layout for this firmware is slightly different: 
* the top right key is now ***delete***, and ***tilde*** is moved to the function layer at the ***escape*** key
* the ***alt*** and ***OS*** button are swapped on the keyboard.

*Notice 2*: This refresh rate reduces battery life, buyer beware
#
## How-to
* Put keyboard in DFU mode by holding *escape* and connecting it to the computer
* Open the drive that is discovered in your file explorer/finder
* Delete the existing **HHKB_BLE.bin** file
* Copy the downloaded **HHKB_BLE.bin** file into the drive
* Eject/unmount the drive, then disconnect keyboard
* Done
